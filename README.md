Hazard free two-level logic generator for BM machine

this is a solution writen in C for generating Hazard free two-level logic minimization 

input file rules

input file use a simple text file format.
it presents a BM(burst mode) machine with input and output variables.
all transition of this machine.
all state condition of this machine.
a example input file provided.


function description 

this program could generate Required Cube, transition type, privileged cube and prime implicant.
furthermore DHF-prime implicant generation will added. 
finally, use self-build BCP solver could complete find solution.

Output file

output file is a print file to show all function working. 
shows the generated required cube, privileged cube and transition type

prime implicant generation part still in processing. 

use Visual studio 2017 to run this program

input file name is input.txt

output file name is output.txt
